# BOA-Gamejam
A 2D isometric pixel game was collaboratively developed by myself and my teammates utilizing the Unity game engine during the 48-hour game jam orchestrated by the Bilkent Game and Animation Club (BOA). Every element within the game, including music, graphics, design, game mechanics, and animations, was meticulously crafted by our team.
